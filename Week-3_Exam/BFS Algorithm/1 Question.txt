Given a graph G = (V, E) set of vertices and edges, Implement Breadth First Search algorithm. Follow the pseudo code (Fig 9.2) given in the LEDA text book.

Input:
The first line of the input contains the number of nodes in the graph.
The second line of the input contains the node number which is used to start traversing the graph.
From the third line of the input onwards, it contains the adjacency matrix of the graph.

Output:
The first line of the output should be the distance from S (Starting Node) to other nodes, separated by comma
The second line of the output contains the BFS Order
