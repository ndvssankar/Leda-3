Modify the DFS algorithm that has been given in the text book, such that label each edge with either tree edge / forward edge or backward edge or cross edge. Check whether the given graph is cyclic or not.

Input :
The first line of the input contains the number of vertices.
The second line of the input contains a positive value, 0 indicates Adjacency List and 1 indicates Adjacency Matrix
The third line of the input contains the starting vertex where you need to traverse the graph using DFS.
The fourth line contains the set of vertices (names) separated by commas (,).
The fifth line onwards contains the Adjacency Matrix / List based on the second line of the input.

Output:
The first line contains the Depth First Search traversal order.
From the second line onwards label each edge with its type (The type of edge may be tree / forward , backward, cross).
The last line of the output should be, if the graph is acyclic, Print "The graph has no cycles" otherwise Print "The graph has cycles".
