BST Rotation.
Implement Binary Search Tree by inserting all the elements into it. After Insertion, Perform rotations in order to make a particular node as root.
Input:
The first line of the input contains the sequence of elements to be inserted into the binary search tree.
The second line of the input contains an element which needs to be make it as root by performing rotations.
The third line of the input contains either 1 / 2 / 3. consider 1 for pre-order traversal, 2 for in-order traversal and 3 for post-order traversal.
Output:
The first line of the output should be the number of rotations to be performed.
The second line of the output should be the sequence of elements to be printed out after rotation and based on the third line of the input.

Example:
17,7,3,2,5,13,11,19
11
3
                    17
            7               19
    3            13 
2     5     11
Now you need to make 11 as root. Perform Right Rotation on 13 which gives
                    17
            7               19
    3            11 
2     5              13
Now Perform Left Rotation on 7 which gives 
                    17
            11               19
        7     13
    3        
2     5 
Now Perform Right Rotation on 17 which gives
               11
        7              17
    3              13       19
2     5
Now the output would be as follows
3  (Number of Rotations)
2,5,3,7,13,19,17,11 (Post Order Traversal)
