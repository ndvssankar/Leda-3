Given a graph G = (V,E) where V is set of vertices and E is set of edges. Represent the graph in memory using Adjacency matrix and adjacency lists.
Input :
The first line of the input contains the pairs of vertices which means there is a direct edge from v1 to v2 and is represented as (v1,v2).
Output :
Adjacency Matrix.
Adjacency Lists.
Example:
Input:
(a,b), (a,c), (a,d), (b,c), (c,d), (c,e), (d,d), (d,b)
Output:
  a b c d e
a 0 1 1 1 0    
b 0 0 1 0 0
c 0 0 0 1 1
d 0 1 0 1 0
e 0 0 0 0 0
